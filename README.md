# SLYDV

*Slides for Developers*

Slydv was developed with developers in mind.   This slick and simple application is constructed to be accessible, secure, and to take the headaches out of making presentation materials (and keep them in your coding, where they belong). 

Slydv allows you to make a slideshow without distracting yourself, providing easy to use, easy to edit markdown based templates, and, best of all, an in-slide repl that can be both pre-populated and live-edited to run your JavaScript code examples in front of your audience, without having jump in and out of different applications. 

A separate presenter-view lets you keep track of where you are in your slide deck, while viewing any notes or scripts you've made for each slide. 

Slydv is written using JavaScript, react-redux, Sequelize and Postgres. 

Other Features (will, eventually, hopefully ) Include: 

- Chats which your audience members can sign into, and ask questions as you present
- A mobile-centered remote control screen to manage your presentation 
- Voice activated presentation control
